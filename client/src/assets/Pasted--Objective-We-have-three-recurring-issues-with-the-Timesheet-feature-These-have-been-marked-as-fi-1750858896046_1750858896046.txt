üö® Objective
We have three recurring issues with the Timesheet feature. These have been marked as fixed multiple times but continue to occur. We now require a comprehensive review and fix:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Edit Timesheet Doesn‚Äôt Preload Existing Data
Issue: When clicking Edit for an existing timesheet, the page loads blank fields instead of the data already saved.

Fix Required:

Ensure the timesheet data is fetched from the database and pre-populated in the form before rendering.

Confirm this applies to every timesheet status except when Approved.

‚úÖ Acceptance Test:
Click Edit -> All fields must be pre-filled with the existing timesheet data.

Change a value and click Save or Submit.

Confirm the timesheet status and data are updated accordingly.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Doesn‚Äôt Refresh Status After Save or Submit
Issue: After making edits and clicking Save or Submit, the status and data do not refresh on the Dashboard. The page must be manually reloaded.

Fix Required:

Implement an auto-refresh of the Dashboard status via:

AJAX call, or

Client-side status reload upon save/submit.

Ensure the status and any updated data are instantly visible.

‚úÖ Acceptance Test:
Save or Submit a timesheet.

Confirm status and data are updated instantly on the Dashboard (without manual page reload).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Timesheet Export Is Corrupt
Issue: Downloaded timesheet files cannot be opened due to formatting or corruption.

Fix Required:

Export files must adhere to their format specifications:

PDFs must have application/pdf mime-type.

Excel files must have application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet mime-type.

Confirm files are saved correctly and tested across common platforms.

‚úÖ Acceptance Test:
Click Download Timesheet.

Confirm the exported file:

Downloads successfully.

Opens correctly in its intended application (PDF reader or Excel).

Displays accurate and complete data.

‚ö°Ô∏è Additional Clarification
We‚Äôve been told repeatedly that these issues have been fixed, but after testing, the same issues recur. We now require:

A full review of the Timesheet feature.

Verified end-to-end testing by the developer.

A screen recording of successful Edit, Save/Submit, and Download operations before closing the issue.

‚ö°Ô∏è Summary of Deliverables
Edit page pre-populates existing data.

Dashboard status refreshes instantly after Save or Submit.

Exported files are valid and open correctly.

Final QA test recording is shared.
